<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
    Unless stated otherwise in these rules, the <a href="https://www.table-soccer.org/rules/documents/ITSFRulesEnglish.pdf">ITSF (International Table Soccer Federation) rule book</a> is followed. However, we hope the competitors will acknowledge
    that this is an amateur tournament and thus in depth understanding and strict following of all rules cannot be enforced.
</p>


<h3>Determining the Tournament Winner</h3>
<p>
    The player with the most points earned is the winner. In a case of a tie, the player with the highest goal difference is the winner. If winner is still not resolved,
    winner will be drawn randomly among those. 
</p>
<p>
    For each game both members of the winning team earn 10 points each. Members of the losing team earn half of their scored goals (rounded down) as points each.
    You can check up-to-date points from the <a href="#!/">Leader Board</a>.
</p>


<h3>Positioning on Offense and Defense</h3>
<p>
        Players of the guest team will choose on which side of the table they want to play. Guest team will also choose first their positioning on offense and defense. After this home team is allowed to choose their offense and defense positioning. When either team reaches five goals, both teams need to switch their offense and defense positioning. Teams are not allowed to switch positioning in any other point during the game.
</p>

<h3>Serve and Ready Protocol</h3>
<p>
    Guest team will start the game by placing the ball at the middle player figure of the five-man rod. The player must move the ball from one player figure to
    another and then wait at least one second before advancing the ball. The player is not required to stop the ball.
</p>
<p>
    Following the first serve of a match, subsequent serves shall be made by the team last scored upon. 
</p>

<h3>Spinning the Rods</h3>
<p>
        Spinning of the rods is illegal. Spinning is defined as the rotation of any soccer figure more than 360 degrees
        before or more than 360° after striking the ball. In calculating the 360° you do not add the degrees spun prior to
        striking the ball to the degrees spun after striking the ball.
</p>

<h3>Dead Ball</h3>
<p>
    A ball shall be declared a dead ball when it has completely stopped its motion and is not within reach of any player figure. 

    <ul>
        <li>If the ball is declared dead anywhere between the five-man rods, it shall be put back into play at the five-man rod by the team who originally served the ball.</li> 
        <li>If the ball is declared dead between the goal and five-man rods, it shall be put back into play at the two-man rod nearest the spot of the dead ball. Play shall resume using the “Ready” Protocol.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Language and Behavior</h3>
<p>
        Unsportsmanlike conduct or comments made directly or indirectly by a player are not allowed. Violations of this
        rule may be grounds for a technical foul. Cursing by a player shall not be allowed. The penalty for cursing is a technical foul.
        Continued cursing by a player may be a cause for forfeiture of games.
</p>
