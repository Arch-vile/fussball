<h3>Teams and matchups</h3>
<p>
    Teams and matches are randomly formed by tournament organizer (you can verify the algorithm from <a href="https://github.com/Arch-vile/fussball">source code</a>). Players are not allowed to switch teams. It is possible to get same team mate or even same opposing more then once.  
</p>

<h3>How do I know when my next game is?</h3>
<p>
    You need to contact your team mate and the oppenent team to agree when you will play. Go to <a ng-href="#!/games">games page</a> and see who are your team mates.
</p>

<h3>How do I report the result of a game?</h3>
<p>
    You report the result by using this web app. Go to <a ng-href="#!/games">games page</a> and find the game. 
    Insert both teams' scores by using the dropdowns, but be careful, you can only report scores once.
</p>

<h3>What if I accidentally report wrong score or for wrong game?</h3>
<p>
    Just dont! If that really happens, contact system administrator (Mikko).
</p>

<h3>Will there be a prize for the winner?</h3>
<p>
    Definitely!
